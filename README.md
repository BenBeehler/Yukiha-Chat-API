# Yukiha-Chat-API
New Chat API designed for discord bot - PersonalityBot. Written in Ruby. (Designed as a layer for cleverbot.io)<br>
# Contributing
Create a fork of the project, and (preferably) insert a new chat reply. If we find your modification interesting, we will accept a merger. <br>
Example (in parser.rb, don't touch configapi.rb ;)):
```ruby
$map[['keyword1', 'keyword2']] = construct("reponse", "")
```
